# MyProjects
This repository will contain the projects that i have made or helped in making thus far. 
These projects were made during the 4 years of my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
The projects vary vastly in terms of programming languages and different platforms used to make these projects.
From C++ to Python to R, the projects range from games to interactive programs to Data Analysis and Statistical Inference.
